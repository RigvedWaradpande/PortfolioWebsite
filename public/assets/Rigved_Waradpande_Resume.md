# PROJECTS

## Encrypting and Decrypting a Binary Sequence Using User Input [[GitHub]](https://github.com/RigvedWaradpande/DSD_EndSem_Project)

_Utilized Verilog programming to simulate a digital system to symmetrically encrypt or decrypt a binary sequence_

- Took user input to decide the process about to happen in the system, emulating electrical circuits inside a machine.
- Used Verilog programming to simulate the electrical circuit, along with GTKWave to analyze the behavior of the circuit for different combinations of electrical impulses.

## Character Creation Game in Java [[Github]](https://github.com/RigvedWaradpande/Java_End_Semester_Project/tree/main)

_Created a mini-game to make your character using Java_

- Used concepts of Object Oriented Programming to create a character and display a turn-based battle against an enemy of your choice.
- Engineered robust back-end architecture with Java, and designed engaging graphics using JavaFX; animated pixelated characters with sprite sheets and embedded themed music

**Personal Shell [[GitHub]](https://github.com/RigvedWaradpande/Shellinator-3000)**

_Created a POSIX-compliant shell to parse built-in and pre-built commands and arguments_

- Implemented using a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which allows the program to wait for user input, evaluate commands and print appropriate output until the user enters 'exit 0'.
- Supports built-ins such as echo, type and exit, and any other program located at a valid location in the system.

## Mobile Reminder App (DBMS)

_Creating a reminder app to gamify your responsibilities_

- Created a reminder app using React Native for developing the app interface and SQLite DB..
- Implemented CRUD operations with a clean UI, using Express.js for connecting DB and frontend.
